# task
To-do Application

Create a task from scratch using Html, Css, then add javascript for the application in order to add tasks, edit tasks, save tasks and delete tasks.

This will also need to be Mobile responsive.

Add data validation (can be an alert) to ensure that the user is entering valid input. 

Connect a database to the application. The userâ€™s tasks should be updated, deleted, read (selected), and inserted in the database.

The Task Tracker Application must be deployed.
